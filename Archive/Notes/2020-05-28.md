# Notes for supervision

## 28th May 2020

### Admin and miscellaneous

* Access to bas_climate workspace but not visible when I login to JASMIN
* Completion of the research skills course with Cambridge University Libraries
* Discussion with Michelle and Omer about best GP platform
* Hackathons. There are a few interesting ones coming up in the next few few weeks. When is it worthwile attending one?

### Reading

I read Anita Faul's chapters and skimmed through 'Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning'. The latter has some good example on model selection so I will start there.

### Correlation plot

I have the real-time version of this plot for the monthly indices. To finish, I need to write a FTP that can download ERA5 data from CEDA without requiring a username.

### Possible next steps

* Finish correlation plot
* Create multivariate GP model with metrics discussed last week
