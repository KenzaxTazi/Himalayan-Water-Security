# Notes for supervision

### Upper Indus Mask

The mask provided by Hamish Pritchard and Tony Phillips is given as a:

1. the fracional overlap of ERA 5 grid with the Upper Indus Basin (values 0-1)
2. a list of 10 Patch objects
3. a list of latitude boundaries
4. a list of longitude boundaries

Below are last weeks plots using the 'overlap' array with values larger than 0 as a mask. These values are now created through a weighted sum rather than multiplying by the average number of days per month.

### Probability distribution

I plotted the probability distribution for each month for whole basin. However it would be far more interesting to divide the areas into sub-basins which have different suceptibilties to westerly fronts (from November) or the Indian Monsoon (July-September) (Dahri et al., 2015). In the figure below it is still possible to observe differences between these two drivers:

* The distributions between July and September has a higher median but is much less difuse.
* The distributions for October to December have low medians and exponentially deacrease for higher precipiations.
* February to April distributions are characterised by very long tails.

### Zeros in data set

112 zeros points in the dataset and even one negative value (-4.163336x10<sup>-16</sup>m). These are occur mostly between the months of October to December. These are also mostly found at the very East or West of the UIB. I got really confused making the last plot. The `plot.pcolormesh()` function in xarray fills in NaNs when it's not suposed to (areas in blue circles).

### Literature

I haven't read any new papers this week.

### Possible next steps

For next week, I could:

1. Download ensemble data for total precipiation,
2. Formulate metrics,
3. Learn how to access and processs JASMIN data,
4. Divide study area into sub basins and their orientations,
5. Download other interesting variables to include in the regression (elevation, pressure, temperature),
6. Read:

    * Mölg T. "Mid-latitude westerlies as a driver of glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia." Nature Climate Change 4.1 (2014): 68-73.
