# Notes for supervision

### Precipitation PDFs

I replotted the probability distribtion funtions with the 95th percentile. I tried to plot them 1 by 12, as suggested, but it makes the distributions harder to compare.

### Clustering

The clusters are generated using the Sci Kit Learn `kmeans` function with median precipicitation of three month periods as inputs:

* July to September
* October to December
* January to March
* April to June

The data is overlayed with elvetion contours (TBASE, 0.25Â° resolution). There is _no_ direct correlation between the clusters and altitude. However, a very clear North-West/South-East divide is observed for all seasons and, generally, higher Ns show more differences between differrent decades. More detailed comments below.

#### January to March

This period is characterised by very dissipated clusters.

#### April to June

A third and fourth central cluster seem to appear from N=4.

#### July to September

The Indian Summer Monsoon occurs over the course of these three months, and where the South-East separation is strongest (visible to N=10). It also presents to most consistent and grouped clusters in the North-West (cf. N=5).

#### October to December

November marks the start of westerly front domination.

#### Annual

I also made a FacetGrid plot for the annual median. The clusters are much more grouped and less variable than the seasonal ones above.

#### Conclusions and discussion points

* Seasonal clusters are very similar to the annual median clusters.The later are less variable and I believe we should use annual clusters going forward.
* Precipitation patterns do not vary drastically from year to year, and we can assume they are stationnary on scales smaller or equal to N=4.
* What N do we want to apply GPs to?

### Possible next steps

* Remove points with a confidence below an arbitrary threshold
* Create data for previously discussed metrics
* Reply to Hamish's email
* Keep building GP
