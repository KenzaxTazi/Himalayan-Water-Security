# Notes for supervision

## 25th June 2020

### MRes report and PhD proposal

* [Report outline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufaf2761jwlvgex/MRes%20Report%20Outline.docx?dl=0)
* Outcomes from OECD meeting:
  * The OECD is speaking to the organisations who would use my model outputs.
  * Get in touch with discussed regional/national organisations for more specific input.
  * How should I be presenting my work? Confusion as to whether I am climate or weather forecasting.
  * Maybe a talk at the end of the year.

### Ensemble Training

The ERA5 Ensemble Data Assimilation (EDA) consists of an ensemble of ten independent lower-resolution 4D-Var assimilations that differ by perturbing observations, sea surface temperature fields and model physics.

#### Averaged Large Scale 2m Temperature

The following table details the output of GP models with the averaged large scale 2m temperature.
