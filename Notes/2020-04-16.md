## Literature

I'm keeping about 2 pages of notes for each paper. This week I've read:

* Lutz AF, et al. “Consistent increase in High Asia's runoff due to increasing glacier melt and precipitation.” Nature Climate Change 4.7 (2014): 587-592.

* Immerzeel WW, et al. “Reconciling high-altitude precipitation in the upper Indus basin with glacier mass balances and runoff.” Hydrology and earth system sciences 19.11 (2015): 4673-4687.
