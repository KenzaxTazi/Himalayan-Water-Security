# Notes for supervion

## 16th April 2020

## Admin

I now have ssh access to JASMIN.

* How do access the data I need?
* Where can I save my code? my processed data? Can I link it to github?

## Plots

Plot of area of interest for 1979 and subsequent changes for 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019.

Timeseries of three locations in the Upper Indus Basin using ERA 5 (31km resolution) total precipitation data from 1979 to 2019. These timeseries are in agreement with the obeserved South-East to North-West increase in precipation (Immerzeel et al 2015).

Conclusions?

Questions:

* What are the delimitations of the Upper Indus Basin?
* Where can I get a mask?
* Will I need to download ArcGIS?

## Linear regression

I started with some Linear Regression for precipation with respect to time and latitude and longitude. We get an RMSE of ** and R^2 of *. Below is a plot of the residuals.

## Literature

I'm keeping about 2 pages of notes for each paper. This week I've read:

* Lutz AF, et al. “Consistent increase in High Asia's runoff due to increasing glacier melt and precipitation.” Nature Climate Change 4.7 (2014): 587-592.

* Immerzeel WW, et al. “Reconciling high-altitude precipitation in the upper Indus basin with glacier mass balances and runoff.” Hydrology and earth system sciences 19.11 (2015): 4673-4687.

* Huss M, et al. "Toward mountains without permanent snow and ice." Earth's Future 5.5 (2017): 418-435.

* Lutz AF et al . “Climate change impacts on the upper Indus hydrology: Sources, shifts and extremes”. PloS one 11.11 (2016).

* Dahri ZH, et al. “An appraisal of precipitation distribution in the high-altitude catchments of the Indus basin.” Science of the Total Environment 548 (2016): 289-306.

## Possible next steps

For next week, I could:

1. Download other interesting variables to include in the regression (elevation, pressure, temperature)
2. Build the gaussian process model on scikit learn for these variables,
3. Start thinking about _monsoon metric_,
4. Read:
    * Huffman G.J. et al. "The TRMM multisatellite precipitation analysis (TMPA): Quasi-global, multiyear, combined-sensor precipitation estimates at fine scales." Journal of hydrometeorology 8.1 (2007): 38-55,
    * Mölg T. "Mid-latitude westerlies as a driver of glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia." Nature Climate Change 4.1 (2014): 68-73.
