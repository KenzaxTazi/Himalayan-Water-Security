# Notes for supervion

## 16th April 2020

## Admin

I now have SSH access to JASMIN.

## Maps

Plot of area of interest for 1979 and subsequent changes for 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019. ERA 5 data was given as daily average for the months. The values were multiplied by the average number of days in a month. Maximum precipition is observed along the Hindu Kush and Karakoram with a maximum of 3.393m/year. It is not clear from these snapshots that there are any trends in precipitations in this period. These maps are not in disagreement with the obeserved South-East to North-West increase in precipation (Immerzeel et al 2015).

__Questions__:

* What are the delimitations of the Upper Indus Basin?
* Where can I get a mask?
* Will I need to download ArcGIS?

## Timeseries

Timeseries of three locations in the Upper Indus Basin using ERA 5 (31km resolution) total precipitation data from 1979 to 2019. Bi-modal distribution for annual precipcipation is expected from the wintertime Westerlies and Indian summer monsoon.

Simple linear regression was applied to these point and net decrease in precipiation was observed. An R<sup>2</sup> of 1.070x10<sup>2</sup>, 0.004x10<sup>2</sup> and 0.230*10<sup>2</sup> was determined for Giglit, Skardu and Leh respectively.

__Questions__:

* What uncertainties are associated with these values?

## Literature

I'm keeping about 2 pages of notes for each paper. This week I've read:

* Lutz AF, et al. “Consistent increase in High Asia's runoff due to increasing glacier melt and precipitation.” Nature Climate Change 4.7 (2014): 587-592.

* Immerzeel WW, et al. “Reconciling high-altitude precipitation in the upper Indus basin with glacier mass balances and runoff.” Hydrology and earth system sciences 19.11 (2015): 4673-4687.

* Huss M, et al. "Toward mountains without permanent snow and ice." Earth's Future 5.5 (2017): 418-435.

* Dahri ZH, et al. “An appraisal of precipitation distribution in the high-altitude catchments of the Indus basin.” Science of the Total Environment 548 (2016): 289-306.

## Possible next steps

For next week, I could:

1. In JASMIN, learn:
    * how to access the data I need,
    * where can I save my code and my processed data, 
    * how to link my github repository.
2. Download other interesting variables to include in the regression (elevation, pressure, temperature)
3. Build the gaussian process model on scikit learn for these variables,
4. Start thinking about _monsoon metric_,
5. Read:
    * Huffman G.J. et al. "The TRMM multisatellite precipitation analysis (TMPA): Quasi-global, multiyear, combined-sensor precipitation estimates at fine scales." Journal of hydrometeorology 8.1 (2007): 38-55,
    * Mölg T. "Mid-latitude westerlies as a driver of glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia." Nature Climate Change 4.1 (2014): 68-73.
    * Lutz AF et al . “Climate change impacts on the upper Indus hydrology: Sources, shifts and extremes”. PloS one 11.11 (2016).
