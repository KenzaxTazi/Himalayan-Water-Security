# Notes for supervision

## 18th June 2020

### PhD Proposal

* Set up meeting with Hamish and Scott to discuss fieldwork
* In touch with OECD climate resilience in moutainous areas team, meeting on Friday 2pm
  * What should I ask her?
* Haven't heard back from Sella Nevo (Google Flood Forecasting Initiative)
  * Try his lecturing email or through Neil Lawrence.

### Cross validation

I set up the 5 fold cross validation is now setup for a single point and for cluster GPs. I will probably go back check the locations the cluster folds are independant enough. Below are the results for Gilgit. They are sligthly worse than previously recorded for the validation set.

|            |  R2   | RMSE  |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| Training   | 0.859 | 0.267 |
| Validation | 0.236 | 1.102 |

* Check the residuals, are we now missing a long term trend? or just better predictive features?

### GP models for ERA5 runs

Set up GP for each ERA 5 run. The models for each run outperform the model for the variance. I think this strongly indicates we should use _ensemble learning_ with _soft voting_. The R2 and RMSE for validation remain quite poor.

|       | Training R2 | Training RMSE | Validation R2 | Validation RMSE |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Run 0 | 0.863 | 0.173 | 0.379 | 0.870 |
| Run 1 | 0.832 | 0.223 | 0.154 | 0.788 |
| Run 2 | 0.830 | 0.207 | 0.430 | 0.861 |
| Run 3 | 0.871 | 0.166 | 0.473 | 0.648 |
| Run 4 | 0.846 | 0.195 | 0.370 | 0.648 |
| Run 5 | 0.852 | 0.189 | 0.433 | 0.939 |
| Run 6 | 0.877 | 0.164 | 0.388 | 0.725 |
| Run 7 | 0.846 | 0.179 | 0.412 | 0.783 |
| Run 8 | 0.855 | 0.195 | 0.286 | 0.796 |
| Run 9 | 0.850 | 0.195 | 0.432 | 0.685 |

### Feature and kernel selection

__Dropped N4 and the NAO indices__. Below are the results for a GP trained on Run 3. Better validation values without the NAO and N4 indices, I was most likely overfitting the training data.

|                | Training R2 | Training RMSE | Validation R2 | Validation RMSE |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| w/o NAO        | 0.859 | 0.185 | 0.207 | 0.824 |
| w/o N4         | 0.855 | 0.185 | 0.478 | 0.867 |
| w/o N4 and NAO | 0.820 | 0.241 | 0.590 | 0.435 |


__Added averaged temperature__. I added the averaged temperature for 20-40°N and 65-85°E with an RBF kernel. This should help incorporate more seasonality into the model. Slightly improved the training scores were observed.

|                | Training R2 | Training RMSE | Validation R2 | Validation RMSE |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| w/ averaged temperature | 0.859 | 0.183 | 0.573 | 0.460 |

__Kernel exploration__ I plotted precipitation as a function of features to determine which kernels to try and how to combine them (addition or multiplication). I noticed that t2m, d2m and tcwv cluster into two or more groups as a function of precipiation. To investigate whether the time of year controlled this bimodal distribution, I will plot the monsoon vs pre-monsoon data seperately.

__Wind and pressure EOFs__. Found a nice [tutorial](http://nicolasfauchereau.github.io/climatecode/posts/eof-analysis-with-scikit-learn/) on how to create EOFs (geographically weighted PCAs). I will start with the areas mentioned in the literature,  in particular the Di Capua et al. paper

### Possible next steps

* Generate and include EOFs
* Run GPs for clusters
* Write code for ensemble training with soft voting
* Check my model is correctly including seasonality
* Extreme precipitation exploration and composite maps
