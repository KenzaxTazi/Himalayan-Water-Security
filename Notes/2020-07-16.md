# Notes for supervision

## 16th July 2020

### MRes report

With the first draft finished, I still need to:

* Finish Results and Conclusion
* Regenerate plots and table with updated results and bigger ticks/legends
* Calculate test set results
* Write the Appendix

### Single location GP

### EOFs

[x] EOF2 data for global z200 done
[x] Correlation with average UIB precipitation
[x] P-value areas (circled areas)

![correlation](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6g9e5kj59m9q84g/Screenshot%202020-07-14%20at%2021.11.24.png?dl=0)

The z200 pressure field over mid Pacific Ocean could be indicative of El Nino and El Nina events, similar to the Nino 3.4 index. The low p values over Brazil, the Atlantic and Ivory Coast are more puzzling.

I'm pretty confident we are not picking up other expected patterns (NAO, circumglobal wavetrain, MJO, BSISO) because they occur on smaller timescales than a month. I could also try to look for reoccuring yearly patterns i.e. sample from different areas for each much.

Another noteworthy point is that the second pressure field EOF over the UIB is not highly correlated with basin precipiation 

* Should we proceed with these areas as GP inputs anyway?

I can format these tables as a plot in the report.

### Hyperparameters

I still need to do some kind of consistent hyperparameter tuning. How should I go about this? Should I only tune my very last model?
