# Notes for supervision

### Precipitation PDFs

I replotted the probability distribtion funtions with the 95th percentile. I tried to plot them 1 by 12, as suggested, but it makes the distributions harder to compare.

### Clustering

The clusters are generated using the Sci Kit Learn `kmeans` function with precipitation and spatial coordinates as inputs. The median precipicitation of three month periods was used:

* July to September
* October to December
* January to March
* April to June

The data is overlayed with elvetion contours (TBASE). There is _no_ apparent correlation between the clusters and altitude. However, a very clear North-West/South-East divide is observed for all seasons and, generally, higher Ns show more differences between differrent decades. More detailed comments below.

#### January to March

This period is characterised by very dissipated clusters.

#### April to June

A third and fourth central cluster seem to appear from N=4.

#### July to September

The Indian Summer Monsoon occurs over the course of these three months, and where the South-East separation is strongest (visible to N=10). It also presents to most consistent and grouped clusters in the North-West (cf. N=5).

#### October to December

November marks the start of westerly front domination.
