# Notes for supervision

## 9th July 2020

### MRes report

* Approx. halfway done with report (excluding Appendix)
* Send Scott the 1st draft by Thursday 16th July (without Appendix)

### Single location GP

Removing the other location variables gives is much better results

|                             | Training R2 | Training RMSE | Validation R2 |  Validation RMSE |
|                             | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Best fit (32.5째N, 77.75째E)  | 0.963 | 0.265 | 0.835 | 0.624 |
| Worst fit (째N, 째E) |
| 50 samples average          |

### EOFs

Method:

__Step 1__: Compute the EOF of the field for each month using the hourly ERA5 data. Keep the EOFs that cumulatively account for over 70% of the field variance.
__Step 2__: Calculate the correlation coefficient of each grid point generated for EOF 1 with the timeseries of the average UIB precipitation. 
__Step 3__: Repeat for the other EOFs
__Step 4__: Retain areas with a p value lower than 0.05.
__Step 5__: Take the average value of each retained areas as a potential input for the GP model.

For the 200hPa pressure field:

### Next steps

* Include EOFs in correlation heat map
* Include most correlated features in final GP model
* Finish writing report
