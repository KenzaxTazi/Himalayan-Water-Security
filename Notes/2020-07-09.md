# Notes for supervision

## 9th July 2020

### MRes report

* Approx. halfway done with report (excluding Appendix)
* Send Scott the 1st draft by Thursday 16th July (without Appendix)

### Single location GP

Removing the other location variables, a GP model for each grid was run. A few data points were unresolvable and these have been removed.

The validation R2 score is highest in the South East of the UIB. However a significant number of point show no correlation of even negative correlation coefficients. The UIB average is close to zero. This suggests we are missing one or more important variables that do not come into play in the Eastern most part of the basin. This area is the dryest in the UIB and mostly under the influence of the ISM.

I'm hopeful that including the z200 pressure field as a proxy for precipitation could provide a better grasp of the model on incoming westerlies.

The validation RMSE scores scale, unsuprisingly, with average precipititaion in each location and poor correlation.

Below are plots of a) a very good fit, b) a terrible fit.

* What happens if I change the models priors / hyperparameters?

### EOFs

Method:

__Step 1__: Compute the EOF of the field for each month using the hourly ERA5 data. Keep the EOFs that cumulatively account for over 70% of the field variance.
__Step 2__: Calculate the correlation coefficient of each grid point generated for EOF 1 with the timeseries of the average UIB precipitation. 
__Step 3__: Repeat for the other EOFs
__Step 4__: Retain areas with a p value lower than 0.05.
__Step 5__: Take the average value of each retained areas as a potential input for the GP model.

For the 200hPa pressure field:

### Random sampling performance as a function of data points

Seed = 42

| EDA average 14,000pts| 0.886 | 0.564 | 0.505 | 1.149 | 1.802 | 2.253 |

In both case the average skill is much better than for single location GPs.

### Next steps

* Include EOFs in correlation heat map
* Include most correlated features in final GP model
* Finish writing report
