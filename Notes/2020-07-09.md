# Notes for supervision

## 9th July 2020

### MRes report

* Approx. halfway done with report (excluding Appendix)
* Send Scott the 1st draft by Thursday 16th July (without Appendix)

### EOFs

Method:

__Step 1__: Compute the EOF of the field for each month using the hourly ERA5 data. Keep the EOFs that cumulatively account for over 70% of the field variance.
__Step 2__: Calculate the correlation coefficient of each grid point generated for EOF 1 with the timeseries of the average UIB precipitation. 
__Step 3__: Repeat for the other EOFs
__Step 4__: Retain areas with a p value lower than 0.05.
__Step 5__: Take the average value of each retained areas as a potential input for the GP model.

For the 200hPa pressure field:

### Performance as a function of data points

|               | Training R2 | Training RMSE | Validation R2 | Validation RMSE | Predicted TP mean | Predicted TP std |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| HRES data (seed = 42, 1,000pts) |
| HRES data (seed = 42, 3,000pts) |
| HRES data (seed = 42, 5,000pts) |
| HRES data (seed = 42, 7,000pts) |
| HRES data (seed = 42, 9,000pts) |
| HRES data (seed = 42, 11,000pts)|

### Next steps

* Include EOFs in correlation heat map
* Include most correlated features in final GP model
* Finish writing report
