# Notes for supervision

## 21st May 2020

### Admin and miscellaneous

* Access to BAS climate workspace on JASMIN
* Discussion on including seasonality and time lags during AI coffee this afternoon

### Clustering

#### Time-series clustering

The clusters are generated using the Sci Kit Learn `k-means` function with precipicitation timeseries of 40 year period. Plotting these clusters brought to light a number of NaNs in the dataset. Using linear interpolation along the coordinates axes, similar results are achieved between different decades for N<6 (see below).

How many nans?

#### Low confidence filtering

Applying a retrospective [soft k-means](https://towardsdatascience.com/confidence-in-k-means-d7d3a13ca856) function to the results, the confidence or 'weight' of each vector is calculated. In the example below, vectors attributed a weight of less than 0.7 are filtered out.

### Metrics

I was able to find almost all the data I needed from our previous discussion with Emily Potter and Andrew Orr from the [ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview) and the [ERA5 monthly averaged pressure levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview) datatasets. 

* __Strength and onset of frontal systems__

  * _IMS indices_. 
    * It turns out there are __many__ indices that try to quantify the strength of the Monsoon, however most of them are calculated using values averaged during the monsoon month (June to September). It is still unclear to me which would be most useful for the problem at hand.
    * The Wang et al. paper focused on the strength of the monsoon at the very East of Asia (105° to 135° E). And suggest to use the AIRI as an index over India where precipicitation is more homogeneous.
    * All Indian Monsoon Index (AIRI) is averaged seasonal rainfall for the whole of India (Parthasarathy et al., 1992). How useful will this indicator be if it includes the value we are trying to predict?
    * Other ISM indices include use eastward wind magnitude at 850hPa for one or the difference between two regions (e.g. Indian Monsoon Index, Convective Indian Index). These are easily created from the ERA5 data.
    * ENSO indice, the variability of the ISM is correlated with the rise and fall of the El Nino. This could be worth including and I can easily download the monthly [Nino 3.4 or Nino 4 indices](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/nino-sst-indices-nino-12-3-34-4-oni-and-tni) from ESRL/NOAA. I could plot both precipitation and the index side by side.

  * _Westerlies_
    * Characterised by a phase \phi and the winds othogonal basis functions calculcated from 0-45°N and 0°-120°E using EOF.
    * Linked to NAO, an [monthly index](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/norm.nao.monthly.b5001.current.ascii.table)  is provided by NOAA.

  * Start with Nino and NAO indices and try to understand the impact of the others better.

* __Relative humidity__
  * 2m dew point temperature (K) (ERA5)
  * total column water vapour (kg m<sup>-2</sup>) (ERA5)
  * or get the relative hunidity for the whole air column (as a function of pressure) (ERA)

* __Orography__
  * orography (m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>) (ERA5)
  * orientation of subgrid scale orography (radians) (ERA5)
  * slope of subgrid scale orography (dimensionless) (ERA5)

### GPyTorch Model

Worked some more on the GPytorch. Including priors for the likelihood and covariance improved the fit for the precipitation only model. There are a lot of different hyperparmeters for me to tune (see table below).

* Number of iterations
* Optimisation function
  * Learning rate
* Likelihood
  * Noise Covariance
  * Noise Prior
  * Raw Noise Constraint
* Mean_module
* Covariance module
  * Base kernel
    * Lengthscale prior
    * Raw lengthscale constraint
    * Period length prior
    * Raw period length constraint
    * Distance module
    * and more!
  * Outputscale_prior
  * Raw_outputscale_constraint

Below are some examples.

### Possible next steps

Clustering

* Plot zero points over a wider region
* Determine the number of NaNs in the dataset
* Create Winter/Monsoon clustering function
* Plot daily precipitation to determine onset of ISM in UIB

GP model

* Organise meeting with Risa for help with GPyTorch
* More reading about westerly and monsoon indices
