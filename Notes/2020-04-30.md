### Precipitation Drivers

* __Large scale atmospheric drivers__, These account for about 40% of the variability in glacier mass balance (proxy for precipitation). The intensity of these events could be understood with proxies outside of the UIB.
  * _Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM)_ (Mölg et al, 2014). Possible model features:
    * The probability of a given area to be affected by the monsoon (see 'Sub-basin orientation' and 'Distance from orographic lift'),
    * The strength of the monsoon for a given year, given as a or a set of indices (Wang et al., 2008).
  * _Westerlies_ (Mölg et al, 2014). They are dominant in the winter but can occur at other times of the year. The fronts can be described by the mid latitude circumglobal wave train and is linked to the North Atlantic climate. Possible model features to account for this driver include:
    * The probability of a given area to be affected by the westerlies (see 'Sub-basin orientation' and 'Distance from orographic lift'),
    * Index for front strength using North Atlantic Climate (Bothe et al., 2011; Branstator, 2002).
    * Index for front strength using in situ wind speed (see 'Wind speed').
  * _Interaction between Westerlies and ISM_ (Mölg et al., 2014). This interaction is still very poorly understood. Low North-South pressure gradient has been linked to low mixing but more research on my part is needed.

* __Orography__, I still want to read around this area to understand what influences rainfall (possibly looking at how orographic rain is characterised in other parts of the word). However, I would include as model features:
  * _Altitude_ (Dahri et al., 2015),
  * _Sub basin orientation_ (Dahri et al., 2015) The orientation of the sub basin decides intense the ISM and Westerlies can be. For example if a basin is parallel to the fronts, we need are much more likely to see strong precipitation. This will feed into the features mentioned above.
  *_Distance from orographic lift_. Assuming that the precipitation from clouds created by the orographic lift of the Himalayas is a function of distance, this variable could help determine the intensity of Westerlies of the ISM for a given area.

* __Local metorological variables__
  * _Pressure gradients_ could give indications of interactions between Westerlies and ISM (Mölg et al., 2014),
  * _Wind speed_ is a good predictor for glacier mass balance and correlate with the strength of the Westerlies (Mölg et al., 2014).

* __Feedbacks__ can influence precipiation distribution but these sseem to be significantly less important than the variables I've put forward so far:
  * _Albedo temperature feedback_ (Qian et al., 2011),
  * _Turbulent heat fluxes_ (Qian et al., 2011).

__Questions__:

* Are there other drivers that I should include? Or drop?

### Toy Gaussian Process Model

I spent a few hours this week playing around with the Sci Kit Learn `GaussianProcessRegressor` class. Below is a plot I made using a Exponentional Sine Squared kernel (`RBF()`). I used the ensemble members of the ERA 5 as the uncertainties of my data points.

### Clustering for weather catchments

I started working on this week, I'm uncertain as to how to make this work in three dimensions. There does not seem to be a function in Sci Kit Learn that is obviously suitable to this problem.

* Do you know of any packages that could help me do this?

### Notes on zero points

The zero points in the previous notes are from th ERA-5 in the original dataset. From the timeseries (see 2020-04-16.md), it does not seem that 1987 was a particularly dry year so these could in fact be missing data. I can look into this futher.

* How do we treat the zero points going forward?

### Literature

This week I read:

* Mölg T. "Mid-latitude westerlies as a driver of glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia." Nature Climate Change 4.1 (2014): 68-73.

### Possible next steps

1. I still need to sit down and start learning how to use JASMIN to run code,
2. Divide study area into sub basins using clustering,
3. Continue developing toy GP model,
4. Download data to create some of the metrics above,
5. More research into relevant features and indices,
6. Continue review of literature.
