# Notes for supervision

### Correlations plots

Below are the correlation plots for monthly averaged metrics previously discussed. The correlations are calculate for the whole UIB and the three clusters generated through soft k-means (threshold=0.7). The plots can be updated in real-time using the Copernicus DataStore API for ERA5 data and the NOAA website for the indices.

### Observations

For the whole UIB, we observe the expected strong correlations between:

* __Nino 3.4 and 4 indices.__ These are calculated using spatially near and overlapping measurements.
* __Total column water vapour (tcwv), 2m dew point temperature (d2m), and orography (z).__ We expect tcwv and d2m to decrease with alitude. 
* __Longitude and latitude.__ The distribution of the data is along a South-East to North West axis.

The total precipipition for the whole region is most correlated to the total column water vapour and least correlated to the indices.

Cluster 0:

* correlation decrease to longitude, latitude and local orographic and meteorological variables
* the angle of the sub basin orography becomes correlated rather than anti-correlated
* correlation increase to Nino 3.4 and 4 indices

Cluster 1:

* Total column water vapour and 2m dew point temperature become more important
* While other metrics decrease in their correlation with total precipitation

Cluster 2:

* correlation decrease to longitude, latitude and local orographic and meteorological variables
* stronger correlation with Nino 3.4

#### Questions

* Should I use finer resolution data for the prediction data?
* How should I ceate my training, validation and testing set moving forward
  * wrt time?
  * wrt location?
* How do I make sure my sets are spatially independant?

### Possible next steps

* Include white noise kernel
* Set up meeting with will Tebutt to discuss how to improve results
* Generalise my functions for ensemble data
* Perform EOF on winds
