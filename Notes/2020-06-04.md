### Correlations plots

Below are the correlation plots for monthly averaged metrics previously discussed. The correlations are calculate for the whole UIB and the three clusters generated through soft k-means (threshold=0.7). The plots can be updated in real-time using the Copernicus DataStore API for ERA5 data and the NOAA website for the indices.

### Observations

For the whole UIB, we observe the expected strong correlations between:

* __Nino 3.4 and 4 indices.__ These are calculated using spatially near and overlapping measurements. 
* __Total column water vapour (tcwv), 2m dew poit temperature (d2m), and orography (z).__ We expect tcwv to decrease as 
* __Longitude and latitude.__ The distribution of the data is along a South-East to North West axis.

The total precipipition for the whole region is most correlated to the total column water vapour and least correlated to the indices. check? mention others?

Cluster 0:

* correlation decrease to longitude, latitude and local orographic and meteorological variables
* correlation increase to Nino 3.4 and 4 indices

Cluster 1:

Cluster 2:

### GP models

* Switched back to GPflow
* Included a linear mean function for model

#### Precipitation only for one location

Linear mean function, periodic RBF kernel

#### Multiple variables for one location

#### Multiple location for one cluster

### Possible next steps
