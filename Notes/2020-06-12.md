* Should I start writing this now? If not when?
* Can you provide feedback on the plan or the content?
* How in depth do the machine learning explanation need to be?
* Is the abstract part of the 5000 word limit?

#### Viva

> w/s 10th August
>
> 20 minutes
>

* Should this include the same content as the report? or something slightly different?

### PhD Proposal and Presentation

#### Proposal

>
> Due 15th July
>
> Audience physical science graduate

#### Presentation

> w/s 27th July
>
> 10 minutes
>
> Audience physical science graduate

* Should this include the same content as the proposal? or something slightly different?

### Cross validation for spatial and timeseries data

* Roberts, David R., et al. "Cross‐validation strategies for data with temporal, spatial, hierarchical, or phylogenetic structure." Ecography 40.8 (2017): 913-929.

--> Non-random block validation
--> Look at the autocorrelation of precipitation over time and space.
