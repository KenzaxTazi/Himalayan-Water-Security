# Notes for supervision

## 8th May 2020

### Admin and miscellaneous

- [Evidence for APPG on Air Pollution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-54AQp0eih8aUavL1wecbX0Icri49pgqNwKuE0dLnC0/edit?usp=sharing>)
- I setup my repository on JASMIN and am able to run code.
- How do I create a pathfile to the data I'm intereste in?
- Should I  request access to BAS workspace on JASMIN?
- Figured out the issue with Xarray plotting. Clusters of data seperated by NaNs are plotted with connecting lines. The solution is to plot the areas of interest seperately. I have flagged this as an issue on the Xarray repository.
- I emailed Tony about the zero points and am still waiting to hear back from him.
- I also spoke to Tom Andersson about the including time and seasonality. He gave a similar suggestions to yours in that I should use circular variable and he agreed that temperature could be a good place to start.

### Precipiation PDFs

Below are the PDFs replotted on a log scale.

### GPflow and GPytorch models

I reproduced last weeks model using GPflow and GPyTorch for just ERA5 precpitiation data. As Risa mentioned on Slack, GPyTorch is more scalable, better maintained and has a lot more documentation even if a little more complex to use. I think I'm going to stick with that for now.

I'm using a periodic kernel with RBF base for the GPflow, and only scaled periodic kernel for the GPyTorch.

Question:

* How would the generated output change if I put all the ensemble points in rather than the variance?

### Clustering

I applied k-means clusters to the UIB with:

* single years/months,
* with different numbers of clusters,
* with and without spatial coordinates.

--> haven't really achieved anything like the known map of the sub-basins so far. The nest thing I could try to clusters is the differences between two years (see 2020-04-23.md )

### Possible next steps

1. Develop multivariate GP model,
2. Download data to create the metrics we discussed last week,
3. More research into relevant features and indices,
4. Continue review of literature.
